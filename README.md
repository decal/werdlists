## <a name="intro"></a>Brief Introduction to `werdlists` :scissors:

This project is a collection of word lists--they are mostly [whitespace-delimited](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal#Whitespace_delimiters)
or line-based.  Although the [`passes-dicts`](passes-dicts "Password Dictionaries") folder contains inputs for [password cracking](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking),
overall the files amassed here are intended to be useful in facilitating
the creation of insecure [program state](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)#Program_state) (with the help of a [black-box fuzzer](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing#Types_of_fuzzers) or scanning
tool.)  The vast majority of files are simply [ASCII](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "American Standard Code for Information Interchange") with the [UNIX](http://unix.org/what_is_unix.html)
style [newline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).  Beware that this project does not attempt in any way to be minimalist or lack verbosity! 

## <a name="inspire"></a>Inspiration Taken From Similar Projects :thought_balloon:
`werdlists` is very similar to [`fuzzdb`](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/ "The attack pattern dictionary") and 
[`SecLists`](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/ "The security tester's companion").  `SecLists` is maintained by my former colleague at [IOActive](https://ioactive.com "IOActive"), [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com).
Admittedly, `werdlists` is quite similar in mission as it's a centralized attack strings 
and [input](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(computer_science)) data resource.  Regardless, `werdlists` expands on a number of concepts: it has its own unique style, organization, 
original hand-crafted contents, dataset creation/management/validation scripts, scanner springboards, etc.

### <a name="unique"></a>Unique Features Only Available With `werdlists` :100: 
`werdlists` cross-references between the code repositories of third-party scanners and its own datasets that each tool will benefit from.
Moreover, there are specialized parsing scripts exclusive to `werdlists` that extract results produced through pairing test tools with its own data.  Output strings are gathered from those results and fed back into the test tools.  In other words, there are a number of interactive and/or
tunable feedback loops implemented.  Quite a few of the `werdlists` data files were created this way.

## <a name="repo"></a>Repository Directory Hierarchy and Structure :nut_and_bolt:

The [`scripts`](scripts) folder consists of [shell scripts](https://www.shellscript.sh "Shell Scripting Tutorial") used for repository maintenance.
There is a sub-directory of `scripts` called `init` where scripts that initialize data files are stored.  If a script filename stored in `init` contains
two dashes, then it's output should reflect the contents of the associated data file.  For example, compare [`manpages-environ`](/decal/werdlists/scripts/init/manpages-environ) 
and [`clib-package-names`](/decal/werdlists/scripts/init/clib-package-names).  All scripts were written using bash syntax.
The [`contrib`](/decal/werdlists/scripts/contrib) folder is for storing scripts contributed via pull request and the [`utils`](/decal/werdlists/scripts/utils) 
folder contains utilities that aren't necessarily specific to the `werdlists` project, such as scripts for managing any wordlist file.
Other data files were manually composed by hand and a small handful were created by recycling output strings back into input parameter lists, i.e. [`dirbdirs-feedback`](/decal/werdlists/scripts/init/dirbdirs-feedback)
The [`tools`](tools) folder lists security tools that the datasets contained in this repository can be provided as input for.
Individual folders are detailed in the <a href="#contents">Folder Names and Description of Contents</a> section below.
All files in each dataset directory are detailed in the local `README.md` file for that folder (as opposed to the global `README.md` in the root directory being read now.)

### <a name="naming"></a>Naming Scheme, Syntax and Meaning :speech_balloon:

Most files have the `*.txt` extension signifying the `text/plain` [MIME type](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)
Often used formats besides plain text include: [Comma-Separated Values](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (`text/csv`), 
[Extended Markup Language](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (`application/xml`),
[Hyper Text Markup Language](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (`application/html`), etc.
Any file that is larger than 1MB uncompressed will be compressed with [xz](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz)
according to the commands in the [`scripts/xzlarge-files`](/decal/werdlists/scripts/xzlarge-files) bash script.  Other file extensions in use are:
`*.ans`, `*.asc`, `*.bin`, `*.c`, `*.conf`, `*.cpp`, `*.csv`, `*.html`, `*.inf`, `*.ini`, `*.json`, `*.md`, `*.rpz`, `*.rst`, `*.sh`, `*.txt`, `*.xml`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `*.zip`, and `*.zone`.

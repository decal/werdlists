    name: RPL_USERHOST
    reply: :[<reply>{<space><reply>}]
    desc: >
      Reply format used by USERHOST to list replies to the query list.
      The reply string is composed as follows:

      <reply> ::= <nick>['*'] '=' <'+'|'-'><hostname>

      The '*' indicates whether the client has registered as an
      Operator. The '-' or '+' characters represent whether the client
      has set an AWAY message or not respectively.

  303:
    name: RPL_ISON
    reply: :[<nick> {<space><nick>}]
    desc: >

    name: RPL_NOWAWAY
    reply: :You have been marked as being away
    desc: >

      RPL_AWAY is sent to any client sending a PRIVMSG to a client which

      is connected. Replies RPL_UNAWAY and RPL_NOWAWAY are sent when the
      client removes and sets an AWAY message.

    desc: >
      Replies 311 - 313, 317 - 319 are all replies generated in response
      to a WHOIS message. Given that there are enough parameters
      present, the answering server must either formulate a reply out of
      the above numerics (if the query nick is found) or return an error
      reply. The '*' in RPL_WHOISUSER is there as the literal character
      and not as a wild card. For each reply set, only RPL_WHOISCHANNELS
      may appear more than once (for long lists of channel names). The
      '@' and '+' characters next to the channel name indicate whether a
      client is a channel operator or has been granted permission to
      speak on a moderated channel. The RPL_ENDOFWHOIS reply is used to
      mark the end of processing a WHOIS message.

      The RPL_TRACE* are all returned by the server in response to the
      TRACE message. How many are returned is dependent on the the TRACE
      message and whether it was sent by an operator or not. There is no
      predefined order for which occurs first. Replies RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN,
      RPL_TRACECONNECTING and RPL_TRACEHANDSHAKE are all used for
      connections which have not been fully established and are either
      unknown, still attempting to connect or in the process of
      completing the 'server handshake'. RPL_TRACELINK is sent by any
      server which handles a TRACE message and has to pass it on to
      another server. The list of RPL_TRACELINKs sent in response to a
      TRACE command traversing the IRC network should reflect the actual
      connectivity of the servers themselves along that path.
      RPL_TRACENEWTYPE is to be used for any connection which does not
      fit in the other categories but is being displayed anyway.

      In processing an LUSERS message, the server sends a set of replies
      from RPL_LUSERCLIENT, RPL_LUSEROP, RPL_USERUNKNOWN,
      RPL_LUSERCHANNELS and RPL_LUSERME. When replying, a server must
      send back RPL_LUSERCLIENT and RPL_LUSERME. The other replies are
      only sent back if a non-zero count is found for them.

      When replying to an ADMIN message, a server is expected to use
      replies RLP_ADMINME through to RPL_ADMINEMAIL and provide a text
      message with each. For RPL_ADMINLOC1 a description of what city,
      state and country the server is in is expected, followed by
      details of the university and department (RPL_ADMINLOC2) and
      finally the administrative contact for the server (an email
      address here is required) in RPL_ADMINEMAIL.

Definitions

c    The literal character c.

C    A single (required) character.

Ps   A single (usually optional) numeric parameter, composed of	one of
     more digits.

Pm   A multiple	numeric	parameter composed of any number of single
     numeric parameters, separated by ;	 character(s).	Individual values
     for the parameters are	listed with Ps .

Pt   A text parameter composed of printable characters.

C1 (8-Bit) Control Characters

The xterm program recognizes both 8-bit	and 7-bit control characters.
It generates 7-bit controls (by	default) or 8-bit if S8C1T is enabled.
The following pairs of 7-bit and 8-bit control characters are equivalent:

ESC D	       Index (IND: 0x84)
ESC E	       Next Line (NEL: 0x85)
ESC H	       Tab Set (HTS: 0x88)
ESC M	       Reverse Index (RI: 0x8d)
ESC N	       Single Shift Select of G2 Character Set (SS2: 0x8e):
	       affects next character only
ESC O	       Single Shift Select of G3 Character Set (SS3: 0x8f):
	       affects next character only
ESC P	       Device Control String (DCS: 0x90)
ESC V	       Start of	Guarded	Area (SPA: 0x96)
ESC W	       End of Guarded Area (EPA: 0x97)
ESC X	       Start of	String (SOS: 0x98)
ESC Z	       Return Terminal ID (DECID: 0x9a).  Obsolete form	of CSI c
	       (DA).
ESC [	       Control Sequence	Introducer (CSI: 0x9b)
ESC \	       String Terminator (ST: 0x9c)
ESC ]	       Operating System	Command	(OSC: 0x9d)
ESC ^	       Privacy Message (PM: 0x9e)
ESC _	       Application Program Command (APC: 0x9f)

These control characters are used in the vtXXX emulation.

VT100 Mode
Most of	these control sequences	are standard VT102 control sequences,
but there is support for later DEC VT terminals	(i.e., VT220 and VT320),
as well	as ISO 6429 and	aixterm	color controls.	 VT102 features	not supported
are auto-repeat and blinking characters.	 There are additional
control	sequences to provide xterm-dependent functions,	such as	the
scrollbar or window size.  Where the function is specified by DEC or ISO
6429, the code assigned	to it is given in parentheses.	The escape codes
to designate and invoke	character sets are specified by	ISO 2022; see
that document for a discussion of character sets.

Single-character functions
BEL	       Bell (Ctrl-G)
BS	       Backspace (Ctrl-H)
CR	       Carriage	Return (Ctrl-M)
ENQ	       Return Terminal Status (Ctrl-E).	 Default response is the
	       terminal	name, e.g., "xterm", but may be	overridden by a
	       resource	answerbackString.
FF	       Form Feed or New	Page (NP) (Ctrl-L) same	as LF
LF	       Line Feed or New	Line (NL) (Ctrl-J)
SO	       Shift Out (Ctrl-N) -> Switch to Alternate Character Set:
	       invokes the G1 character	set.
SP	       Space.
TAB	       Horizontal Tab (HT) (Ctrl-I)
VT	       Vertical	Tab (Ctrl-K) same as LF
SI	       Shift In	(Ctrl-O) -> Switch to Standard Character Set:
	       invokes the G0 character	set (the default).

Controls beginning with	ESC (other than	those where ESC	is part	of a
7-bit equivalent to 8-bit C1 controls),	ordered	by the final character(s).
ESC SP F       7-bit controls (S7C1T).
ESC SP G       8-bit controls (S8C1T).
ESC SP L       Set ANSI	conformance level 1 (vt100, 7-bit controls).
ESC SP M       Set ANSI	conformance level 2 (vt200).
ESC SP N       Set ANSI	conformance level 3 (vt300).

	       Final character C for designating character sets	(0 , A
	       and B  apply to VT100 and up, the remainder to VT220 and
	       up):

	       effect in xterm.
ESC ~	       Invoke the G1 Character Set as GR (LS1R).  Has no visible
	       effect in xterm.

Application Program-Control functions
APC Pt ST      xterm implements	no APC functions; Pt is	ignored.  Pt
	       need not	be printable characters.

Device-Control functions
DCS Ps;	Ps| Pt ST
	       User-Defined Keys (DECUDK).  The	first parameter:
		 Ps = 0	 -> Clear all UDK definitions before starting
	       (default)
		 Ps = 1	 -> Erase Below	(default)
	       The second parameter:
		 Ps = 0	 -> Lock the keys (default)
		 Ps = 1	 -> Do not lock.
	       The third parameter is a	';'-separated list of strings
	       denoting	the key-code separated by a '/'	from the hex-
	       encoded key value.  The key codes correspond to the DEC
	       function-key codes (e.g., F6=17).
DCS $ q	Pt ST  Request Status String (DECRQSS).	 The string following
	       the "q" is one of the following:
		 " q	      -> DECSCA
		 " p	      -> DECSCL
		 r	      -> DECSTBM
		 m	      -> SGR
	       xterm responds with DCS 1 $ r Pt	ST for valid requests,
	       replacing the Pt	with the corresponding CSI string, or
	       DCS 0 $ r Pt ST for invalid requests.
DCS + q	Pt ST  Request Termcap/Terminfo	String (xterm, experimental).
	       The string following the	"q" is a list of names separated
	       by ; which correspond to	termcap	or terminfo key	names.
	       xterm responds with DCS 1 + r Pt	ST for valid requests,
	       replacing the Pt	with the corresponding strings that
	       xterm would send, or DCS	0 + r Pt ST for	invalid
	       requests.  The strings are encoded in hexadecimal (2 digits
	       per character), and are separated by	;  if more than
	       one name	was requested.

	       The VT100-style response	parameters do not mean anything
	       by themselves.  VT220 parameters	do, telling the	host
	       what features the terminal supports:

		 -> 2  Printer
		 -> 6  Selective erase
		 -> 8  User-defined keys
		 -> 9  National	replacement character sets
		 -> 1 5	 Technical characters
CSI > Ps c     Send Device Attributes (Secondary DA)
		 Ps = 0	, 1 or omitted -> request the terminal's identification code.
	       The response depends on the decTerminalId resource	setting.  
         It should apply only to VT220	and up, but xterm extends this to VT100.

	       If 16-color support is compiled,	the following apply.
	       Assume that xterm's resources are set so	that the ISO

		 Ps = 9	1  -> Set foreground color to Red
		 Ps = 9	2  -> Set foreground color to Green
		 Ps = 9	3  -> Set foreground color to Yellow

		 Ps = 1	0 5  ->	Set background color to	Magenta
		 Ps = 1	0 6  ->	Set background color to	Cyan
		 Ps = 1	0 7  ->	Set background color to	White

	       If xterm	is compiled with the 16-color support disabled,
	       it supports the following, from rxvt:
		 Ps = 1	0 0  ->	Set foreground and background color to
	       default

	       If 88- or 256-color support is compiled,	the following

	       Enable Filter Rectangle (DECEFR)
	       Parameters are [top;left;bottom;right].
	       Defines the coordinates of a filter rectangle and activates
	       it.  Anytime the locator is detected outside of the
	       filter rectangle, an outside rectangle event is generated
	       and the rectangle is disabled.  Filter rectangles are
	       always treated as "one-shot" events.  Any parameters that
	       are omitted default to the current locator position.  If
	       all parameters are omitted, any locator motion will be
	       reported.  DECELR always	cancels	any prevous rectangle
	       definition.

		 Ps = 1	 -> Locator enabled
		 Ps = 2	 -> Locator enabled for	one report, then disabled
	       The second parameter specifies the coordinate unit for
	       locator reports.

		 Pu = 1	 -> device physical pixels
		 Pu = 2	 -> character cells
CSI Pm ` {     Select Locator Events (DECSLE)
	       Valid values for	the first (and any additional parameters are:
		 Ps = 0	 -> only respond to explicit host requests
	       (DECRQLP)
			    (default) also cancels any filter rectangle
		 Ps = 1	 -> report button down transitions
		 Ps = 2	 -> do not report button down transitions
		 Ps = 3	 -> report button up transitions

CSI Ps ` |     Request Locator Position	(DECRQLP)
	       Valid values for	the parameter are:
		 Ps = 0	, 1 or omitted -> transmit a single DECLRP locator report

	       If Locator Reporting has	been enabled by	a DECELR, xterm
	       will respond with a DECLRP Locator Report.  This	report
	       is also generated on button up and down events if they
	       have been enabled with a	DECSLE,	or when	the locator is
	       detected	outside	of a filter rectangle, if filter rectangles
	       have been enabled with a DECEFR.

		 -> CSI	Pe ; Pb	; Pr ; Pc ; Pp &  w

	       Parameters are [event;button;row;column;page].
	       Valid values for	the event:
		 Pe = 0	 -> locator unavailable	- no other parameters
	       sent
		 Pe = 1	 -> request - xterm received a DECRQLP
		 Pe = 2	 -> left button	down
		 Pe = 3	 -> left button	up
		 Pe = 4	 -> middle button down
		 Pe = 5	 -> middle button up
		 Pe = 6	 -> right button down
		 Pe = 7	 -> right button up
		 Pe = 8	 -> M4 button down
		 Pe = 9	 -> M4 button up
		 Pe = 1	0  -> locator outside filter rectangle
	       ``button'' parameter is a bitmask indicating which buttons
	       are	pressed:
		 Pb = 0	 -> no buttons down
		 Pb & 1	 -> right button down
		 Pb & 2	 -> middle button down
		 Pb & 4	 -> left button	down
		 Pb & 8	 -> M4 button down
	       ``row'' and ``column'' parameters are the coordinates of
	       the locator position in the xterm window, encoded as
	       ASCII decimal.
	       The ``page'' parameter is not used by xterm, and	will be
	       omitted.

PC-Style Function Keys
If xterm does minimal translation of the function keys,	it usually does
this with a PC-style keyboard, so PC-style function keys result.  Sun
keyboards are similar to PC keyboards.	Both have cursor and scrolling
operations printed on the keypad, which	duplicate the smaller cursor and
scrolling keypads.
X does not predefine NumLock (used for VT220 keyboards)	or Alt (used as
an extension for the Sun/PC keyboards) as modifiers.  These keys are
recognized as modifiers	when enabled by	the numLock resource, or by the
DECSET 1 0 3 5	control	sequence.
The cursor keys	transmit the following escape sequences	depending on the
mode specified via the DECCKM escape sequence.

		      Key	  Normal    Application
		  --------------------------------------
		  Cursor Up	 CSI A	    SS3	A
		  Cursor Down	 CSI B	    SS3	B
		  Cursor Right	 CSI C	    SS3	C
		  Cursor Left	 CSI D	    SS3	D

The application	keypad transmits the following escape sequences	depending
on the mode	specified via the DECPNM and DECPAM escape sequences.
Use the	NumLock	key to override	the application	mode.
Not all	keys are present on the	Sun/PC keypad (e.g., PF1, Tab),	but are
supported by the program.

Older versions of xterm	implement different escape sequences for F1
through	F4.  These can be activated by setting the oldXtermFKeys
resource.  However, since they do not correspond to any	hardware terminal,
they have been deprecated.	 (The DEC VT220	reserves F1 through F5
for local functions such as Setup).

In normal mode,	i.e., a	Sun/PC keyboard	when the sunKeyboard resource is
false, xterm recognizes	function key modifiers which are parameters
appended before	the final character of the control sequence.

		       8       Shift + Alt + Control

For example, shift-F5 would be sent as CSI 1 5 ; 2 ~

If the alwaysUseMods resource is set, the Meta modifier	also is	recognized,
making parameters 9 through 16.

VT220-Style Function Keys
However, xterm is most useful as a DEC VT102 or	VT220 emulator.	 Set the
sunKeyboard resource to	true to	force a	Sun/PC keyboard	to act like a
VT220 keyboard.
The VT102/VT220	application keypad transmits unique escape sequences in
application mode, which	are distinct from the cursor and scrolling keypad:

The VT220 provides 8 additional	function keys.	With a Sun/PC keyboard,
access these keys by Control/F1	for F13, etc.

VT52-Style Function Keys
A VT52 does not	have function keys, but	it does	have a numeric keypad
and cursor keys.  They differ from the other emulations	by the prefix.
Also, the cursor keys do not change:

Sun-Style Function Keys
The xterm program provides support for Sun keyboards more directly, by a
menu toggle that causes	it to send Sun-style function key codes	rather
than VT220.  Note, however, that the sun and vt100 emulations are not
really compatible.  For	example, their wrap-margin behavior differs.
Only function keys are altered;	keypad and cursor keys are the same.
The emulation responds identically.  See the xterm-sun terminfo	entry
for details.

HP-Style Function Keys
Similarly, xterm can be	compiled to support HP keyboards.  See the
xterm-hp terminfo entry	for details.

Mouse Tracking
The VT widget can be set to send the mouse position and	other information
on	button presses.	 These modes are typically used	by editors and
other full-screen applications that want to make use of	the mouse.

There are six mutually exclusive modes.	 One is	DEC Locator mode,
enabled	by the DECELR CSI Ps ; Ps  z control sequence,	and is not
described here.	 The remaining five modes are each enabled (or disabled)
by a different parameter in DECSET CSI ? Pm h or DECRST	CSI ? Pm l control
sequence.

Manifest constants for the parameter values are	defined	in xcharmouse.h
as follows:

		#define	SET_X10_MOUSE		    9
		#define	SET_VT200_MOUSE		    1000
		#define	SET_VT200_HIGHLIGHT_MOUSE   1001
		#define	SET_BTN_EVENT_MOUSE	    1002
		#define	SET_ANY_EVENT_MOUSE	    1003

The motion reporting modes are strictly	xterm extensions, and are not
part of	any standard, though they are analogous	to the DEC VT200 DECELR
locator	reports.

Parameters (such as pointer position and button	number)	for all	mouse
tracking escape	sequences generated by xterm encode numeric parameters
in a single character as value+32.  For	example, !  specifies the value
1.  The	upper left character position on the terminal is denoted as 1,1.

X10 compatibility mode sends an	escape sequence	only on	button press,
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.  It	is enabled by
specifying parameter 9 to DECSET.  On button press, xterm sends	CSI M
CbCxCy (6 characters).	Cb is button-1.	 Cx and	Cy are the x and y
coordinates	of the mouse when the button was pressed.

Normal tracking	mode sends an escape sequence on both button press and
release.  Modifier key (shift, ctrl, meta) information is also sent.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1000	to DECSET.  On button press or
release, xterm sends CSI M CbCxCy.  The	low two	bits of	Cb encode button
information: 0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.
The next three bits encode the modifiers which were down when the button
was pressed and	are added together:  4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.  Note
however	that the shift and control bits	are normally unavailable because
xterm uses the control modifier	with mouse for popup menus, and	the
shift modifier is used in the default translations for button events.
The Meta modifier recognized by	xterm is the mod1 mask,	and is not 
necessarily the "Meta" key	(see xmodmap).	Cx and Cy are the x and	y 
coordinates	of the mouse event, encoded as in X10 mode.

Wheel mice may return buttons 4	and 5.	Those buttons are represented by
adding 64 to the event code.

Mouse hilite tracking notifies a program of a button press, receives a
range of lines from the	program, highlights the	region covered by the
mouse within that range	until button release, and then sends the program
the release coordinates.  It is	enabled	by specifying parameter	1001 to
DECSET.	 Highlighting is performed only	for button 1, though other button
events can be received.  Warning: use of this mode requires	a cooperating
program	or it will hang	xterm.	On button press, the same information
as for normal tracking is generated; xterm then waits for the program
to send	mouse tracking information.  All X events are ignored until the
proper escape	sequence is received from the pty: CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps ; Ps ; Ps T .
The parameters are func, startx, starty, firstrow, and lastrow.  func is 
non-zero to initiate hilite tracking and zero	to abort.	startx and starty 
give the starting x and y location for the highlighted region.  The ending
location tracks	the mouse, but will never be above row firstrow and	will
always be above row lastrow.  (The top of the screen is row 1.)  When the 
button is released, xterm reports the ending position one	of two ways: 
if	the start and end coordinates are valid text locations: CSI t	CxCy.
If either coordinate is past the end of the line: CSI T CxCyCxCyCxCy.
The parameters are startx, starty, endx, endy, mousex, and	mousey.
startx, starty, endx, and endy give the starting and ending character
positions	of the region.	mousex and mousey give the	location of the
mouse at button	up, which may not be over a character.

Button-event tracking is essentially the same as normal	tracking, but
xterm also reports button-motion events.  Motion events	are reported
only if	the mouse pointer has moved to a different character cell.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1002	to DECSET.  On button press or
release, xterm sends the same codes used by normal tracking mode.  On
button-motion events, xterm adds 32 to the event code (the third charac­
ter, Cb).  The other bits of the event code specify button and modifier
keys as	in normal mode.	 For example, motion into cell x,y with	button 1
down is	reported as CSI	M @ CxCy.  ( @	= 32 + 0 (button 1) + 32 (motion
indicator) ).  Similarly, motion with button 3 down is reported	as CSI M
B CxCy.	 ( B  =	32 + 2 (button 3) + 32 (motion indicator) ).

Any-event mode is the same as button-event mode, except	that all motion
events are reported instead of just those that enter a new character
cell.  It is enabled by	specifying 1003	to DECSET.

Tektronix 4014 Mode
Most of	these sequences	are standard Tektronix 4014 control sequences.
Graph mode supports the	12-bit addressing of the Tektronix 4014.  The
major features missing are the write-through and defocused modes.  This

ObBusinessHack: Customer wants a CD-ROM multimedia encyclopaedia, so I buy a
Soundblaster Pro for #75 which comes bundled with a multimedia encyclopaedia
CD-ROM. After carefully removing the "not to be sold separately" notice from
the CD, I sell it on for #75. Result: One free Soundblaster Pro and a happy
(but gullible) customer.  (Allegedly ;)

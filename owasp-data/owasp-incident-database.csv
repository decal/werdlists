Their account of how their own web site was defaced is a classic. And no, it was not their fault.

2007-32,WHID 2007-32: XSS vulnerability on various German online banking sites,"<p>I seldom add disclosures anymore to WHID, even less XSS disclosures, but since this time they were discovered in banking sites, I thought it was worth it.

2007-33,WHID 2007-33: THAILAND: ICT Ministry website sabotaged by hacker,"<p>While defacements are usually not the bread and butter of this database, when it hits an important government site, especially of a ministry in charge of information technology, it is worth mentioning it.

2007-38,WHID 2007-38: Gentoo takes server offline due to security vulnerabilities,"<p>This gem is very interesting since it happened on Gentoo servers. It therefore combines transparency into the incident that only an open source project can offer with the importance and resource of a large one.

That no server is secure, and that patching is hard.
2007-39,WHID 2007-39: Hacker sabotages Peru president&#039;s Web site,"<p>Defacements seem to start dominating this list. Alas, they are the most obvious web site hacks out there. While not every defacement is reported in the Web Hacking Incidents Database, key ones are.  I included this one since the attacked web site is significant, and since it emphasizes what is becoming a major goal of attacking: politics and international affairs. <br />As a side note, this incident is also interesting because it was repeated after discovered and presumably fixed, which goes a long way to show how much effort there is in protecting web sites and how difficult it cab be.
2007-40,WHID 2007-40: County&#039;s Web site hacked; no data lost,"<p>Defacements seem to dominate the list recently, probably because they reach everywhere.

2007-43,WHID 2007-43: Hacker attacks the Ministry for Housing website as Spanish mortgages come under the international spotlight,"<p>Yet another defacement, and as usual in the political arena.<br />However, this one is worth a note as the attack is very targeted, while<br />usually such political defacements are carried quote randomly against<br />sites loosely related to the opponent and usually has little to do with<br />the actual message the attackers want to convey. In this case the<br />defacement seems to be a direct response to the hot debate about<br />housing prices in Spain.<br /></p>

2007-53,WHID 2007-53: Google&#039;s Advanced Search Operators Abused by Spammers,"<p>While most WHID entries are about web site breaches, sometimes vulnerability in a web application is used indirectly. Redirection functions in web applications are commonly used by spammers and phishers. It allows them to include a honest looking URL in their e-mail, this way bypassing spam filters and observant users.</p>
2007-54,WHID 2007-54: Mistake Left Constables Open To ID theft,"<p>An Excel spreadsheet was published on containing sensitive information regarding police officers in York, England.

2007-65,WHID 2007-65: Facebook suing a porn site over automated access,"<p>Use of robots and automated software against a web site, as long as it is not done in order to break into the site, falls into a grey area. While hard to classify as an unlawful act, it is usually harmful to the site owner and possibly to the site users. Apart from using valuable resources, such an automated access may breach the site's usage license of public information and might also indicate unlawful activity such as using a botnet. Many times it is hard to know if such a blast of requests is a denial of service attack, brute force password cracking or just a search engine crawler.</p>
2007-66,WHID 2007-66: Hacker Conquer French Embassy In Libya Web Site,"<p>To iframe or not to iframe, this is the question. As malware becomes more popular, the number of incidents, mostly insignificant, in which malware was planted on a hacked site is rising and WHID is not the right place to list all of them. We currently report such incidents if the hacked site is of interest or if the Attack_Method is known.
2007-67,WHID 2007-67: The Day My Web Site Was Hacked,"<p>In an incident very similar to the <a href=""byid.php?id=2007-61"">Al Gore Hack</a>, the personal blog of IT journalist Tim Anderson was also hacked. Unlike Mr. Gore, Tim discusses the breach and its origins.

The Indonesian hacker Hmei7 has left the message ""Hmei7 has touched your soul"" on the Web site of the police department in Tucson, Arizona. Only unlike regular defacement, this time it is not the front page but rather the news section that was modified.</p>
2007-71,WHID 2007-71: Hacker uses Social Security numbers from Ohio court site,"<p>The Secret Service has arrested at least 6 people in an investigation that involves information theft at an Ohio court web site, which is actively used for identity theft.

2007-76,WHID 2007-76: A large web hosting firm inflicted by mass malware installation,"<p>The Washington Post ran a story about a large scale infiltration to IPower, a major hosting provider. According to the story and the following comments, it seems that the problem is plunging IPower for a long time without being resolved. Put in perspective the <a href=""byid_id_2007-75.shtml"">PlusNet incident</a> which was serious but swiftly handled and publicly acknowledged by the company.</p>
2007-77,WHID 2007-77: HostGator: cPanel Security Hole Exploited in Mass Hack,"<p>Hackers exploited an unknown cPanel vulnerability to break into HostGator servers and plant malware on hosted sites.

2007-79,WHID 2007-79: Infamous Russian malware gang used SQL injection to penetrate US government sites,"<p>RBN was a big story. It was a hackers group that could work relatively freely in Russia due to rumors connections in high windows. This way it could allow safe hosting for malware. For getting people to the malware they penetrated web sites around the world, and the references article mentioned SQL injection as the method they infiltrated more high profile sites such as US government sites.
2007-80,WHID 2007-80: Vodafone blocks website after hacking,"<p>Yet another defacement, but this time at a very major telecommunication provider in India. These are the guys in charge of our network after all!
2007-81,WHID 2007-81: MSNBC Turkish site caught serving malware,"<p>Another Malware defacement, but this time at a very prominent web site: MSNBC Turkish edition. There are indications that this is an application layer attack.
2007-82,WHID 2007-82: An SQL injection Mass Robot,"<p>An SQL injection robot is running wild and has already hacked hundreds of thousands of web sites.

2007-84,WHID 2007-84: Soccer league&#039;s online shoppers get kicked by security breach,"<p>It is already February, and we still add 2007 incidents. If<br />you wonder why, it is because organizations such as MLS only now find<br />out that they were hacked last year! Sometime between January and<br />August of 2007, names, addresses, credit and debit card data, and<br />passwords of an unknown number of people, including 169 New Hampshire<br />residents were stolen from the site.</p>
2007-85,WHID 2007-85: IndiaTimes.com Visitors Risk High Exposure To Malware,"<p>The web site of a leading Indian newspaper is swamped with malware.

This is a major shift in the threat landscape, since keeping to web sites that you know is no longer a good protection strategy. Anecdotally undermining WebSense own web site classification technology as a security solution.
2007-86,WHID 2007-86: Mac Blogs defaced using XSS,"<p>The standard disclaimer that we do not cover each and every defacement is relevant to this entry as well. So why do we include the defacement incident this time? First and foremost, it is known to be an XSS abusing a WordPress zero day bug. Secondly, it is a targeted attack aiming to deface only Mac related web sites. Usually targeted defacement attacks are carried out against political targets. Did attacking apple become a political issue? Was Apple transformed into a nation overnight? Well certainly into a cult.</p>

2008-02,WHID 2008-02: Italian Bank&#039;s XSS Opportunity Seized by Fraudsters,"<p>It has been a while since a phishing scam using XSS vulnerability found its way to the Web Hacking Incidents database (<a href=""http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2004-11.shtml"">SunTrust, WHID 2004-11</a>). The current incident is a good example of what does and does not get into our database: XSS vulnerabilities in public web sites are discovered daily and reported in sites such as <a href=""http://www.xssed.org/"">XSSed</a>, however most of these vulnerabilities are not included in WHID for lack of public interest. The current incident is different since the vulnerability is known to be exploited by attackers, moving it from the realm of technical interest to the realm of a real problem.</p>
2008-04,WHID 2008-04: RIAA web site cleared,"<p>The web site of RIAA, the Recording Industry Association of America was attacked twice using SQL injection over the weekend. First a <a href=""http://reddit.com/info/660oo/comments/"">query that takes particularly long time was posted on a social network web site</a> causing a distributed denial of service attack against the site. Later on hackers found and abused additional SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities resulting in major defacement of the site.</p>

In this extraordinary incident, a hacker broke to the web site of the Ecuadorian president and said nice things about him. So nice in fact that the presidential office had to apologize in front of the opposition leader. Was it a hack or an over enthusiastic marketing person?
2008-12,WHID 2008-12: Greek ministry websites hit by hacker intrusion,"<p>This is yet another case of defacement of a governmental web site. It is amazing to note it is nearly never the large commercial and financial web sites that are defaced. It is either small mom and dad shops or government and political web sites. Don't you get the feeling the government IT is run like a mom and dad shop? Do you wonder if it is only the IT part that is run that way?

2008-15,WHID 2008-15: ValueClick to Pay $2.9 Million to Settle FTC Charges,"<p>In this case SQL injection was not the root cause, but rather the justification. Just as Al Capone was arrested at the end of the day for tax evasion, ValueClick, which seems to infuriate the FTC over many nasty commercial misdeeds, was caught at the end of the day for SQL injection, presumably left open against the company written security policy.</p>
2008-16,WHID 2008-16: Turkish PM supporters hack hacker&#039;s Web site,"<p>In a twist on the classical defacement incident, supporters of the Turkish PM defaced, as a retaliation, the web site of hackers who just recently defaced the PM web site. A disturbing question is whether this is a juvenile mischief or was the act planned and executed by PM supporters. Did the political spin reached web site hacking?</p>

An interesting <a href=""http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?discuss=208187633&amp;return=1"">report </a>on Kasperski viruslist blog by a person on the investigating team provides answers: the data was neither secured well nor the hacker incapable.

2010-26,WHID 2010-26: Russia Arrests Alleged Mastermind of RBS WorldPay Hack,"A fascinating story about a group of hackers who broke into the RBS WorldPay DBs through SQL Injection.  Russian authorities have nabbed the man accused of masterminding a coordinated global ATM heist of $9.5 million from Atlanta-based card processing company RBS WorldPay.  The hackers compromised RBS WorldPay???s database encryption to raise the amount of funds available on the compromised cards, and boost their daily withdrawal limits. In some case, the hackers raised the limits to $500,000.  According to the indictment, Tsurikov conducted reconnaissance of the RBS network after Covelin provided him with information about vulnerabilities in the system. Pleshchuk and Covelin then worked on exploiting the vulnerabilities to obtain access. Pleschuk allegedly developed the method for reverse engineering the encrypted PINs.  Once the hackers raised the account limits, they provided an army of cashers with 44 cards programmed with the account details. On November 8 that year, the cashers simultaneously hit more than 2,000 ATMs, netting about $9.5 million in less than 12 hours.

Like every war, this one is not one sided.

<li>Lastly 4chan developed sophisticated robots to auto-vote. Those robots overcome Time's anti-automation protections: since each user is allowed to vote just once in every 13 seconds, the robots uses open proxies to vote faster. Since time only prevents voting for the same person from the same IP, the robots used the extra 12 seconds available for each source IP to vote down competitors. The system also reports to a central server allowing monitoring of the voting rate!</li>

<li>The Time voting mechanism did not even check that the ranking in the vote was legal, so a link to vote down ""moot"" competitors in the list was also used until Time fixed the issue.

<p>A <a href=""http://hackedphpbb.blogspot.com/2009/01/place-holder.html"">very detailed report </a>of the incident by the hacker shed light on how such hacks are carried out, including what the hacker went after and his exploitation techniques . The hacker found the exploit on <a href=""http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/7778"">milw0rm</a>, a well known exploit repository, showing that public disclosure of vulnerabilities has its price, especially when it precedes the release if the patch.</p>
<p>A byproduct if this vector is that is that results are catastrophic for the site owners. While in a case of common defacement attacks restoring (or recreating) the homepage is all it required to get back to business, in this case the whole database is ruined. Considering the scope of the attack and that restoring the database, if it was ever backup, requires much more expertise, the overall damage of this attack is very high.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://doj.nh.gov/consumer/pdf/fiserv.pdf"">CheckFree report to the authorities</a>, it estimates that around 160,000 customers where expoesed to the attack, and informed 5 million potential victims who may have been among this group.</p>

<p>A Korean e-commerce site was hacked and a staggering number of record, 18 million, where stolen. In the US this would be front news. We don't know if it was front news in Korea, but did not get to the international media.</p>

<p>An interesting side story is that Oliver Friedrichs from Symantec was <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9077198"">quoted in a Computer World article</a> only a week earlier saying that presidential campaign web sites are ""clueless"" about security. Was this a prophecy of or the trigger for the hack?</p>
<p>Another insight is that real time controls for protecting web applications are essential. You need a WAF.

<p>Apart from, or actually because of  the fact that the victims are security experts, this story is noteworthy due to two additional twists in the plot:</p>
<p>Are domain hacking a case of web hacking? should they be included in WHID? in this case it seems, according to the <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/05/comcast-hijacke.html"">Wired report</a> that the hack itself involved attacking the domains registrar's (Network Solutions) web interface.</p>
<p>A researcher <a href=""http://hackersblog.org/2009/02/07/usakasperskycom-hacked-full-database-acces-sql-injection/"">found and exploited</a> a serious SQL injection vulnerability in US web site of Kasperski, an anti-virus software vendor, exposing the full customers database. Well, the full database actually as the list of tables exposed proves. <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/09/kaspersky_compromise_follow_up/"">Apparently</a>, the vulnerability existed for some time and the researched informed Kasperski about it to no avail before making it public.</p>
<p>As a security practitioner I often see SQL injection bots, and many times when I install ModSecurity, an open source application firewall but this bot is unique in the way it exploits web sites. It is easier to perform a wide scale attack by exploiting the least common denominator, which in the hacking world is the operating system. As a result most SQL bots tend to try to use SQL injection vectors that will enable issuing OS commands. A good example is a <a href=""http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21799/discuss"">Cacti vulnerability</a>: since it allows an OS command to be issued I often see bots looking for it in the wild. This attack is the first I have seen in which the actual attack vector is SQL based. The bot is modifying every record it has access to into a malicious code in the hope that it will be fetched and displayed by the application to its users.</p>
<p>As many you know, the news section is one of the few database driven parts in many mostly static sites, as it allows the site owner to add news without requiring  a web designer. Therefore it came as no surprise that the attack was identified by a public source as an SQL injection attack.</p>
<p>As tiny as VAServ is, probably no more than 3 people, in today's virtual and flat world they could serve tens of thousands of low cost web sites, many of them now lost for ever. Behind each one of these web sites there is a story of someone who worked hard, whether on a hobby or a small business and is now left with nothing. A comment made on one of the blog entries about the incident reads:</p>
<p>As usual in such cases there is a question of whether the attack was a criminal activity, violation of the license agreement of the information provider or plainly legal. In this regard it is interesting to note that the group arrested in the incident was also responsible for the hacking to <a href="" http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2005-5.shtml"">Paris Hilton Vodafone account</a>, which was clearly an unlawful act.
<p>As usual, the marketing department <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10163227-83.html"">response </a>is amazing, mentioning that ""<em>the problem with its site was due to a bug in a Web application and not related to an unpatched system</em>"". Does that make it better?</p>

<p>At this time the only abuse known is a fraudulent use of about a 100 reloadable cards, which are used by companies to pay their employees.</p>
<p>A unique form of SQL injection, or even just a close sibling, remote SQL by design is a vulnerability in which the web application accepts SQL statements from the client in the normal course of operation. The SQL statement might be used in a hidden field, or generated on the fly by a client side script. In any case, it is extremely difficult to prevent alteration of the SQL statement by a user in such applications, making the applications highly vulnerable.</p>
<p>A very detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability is included in a <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=481558"">FireFox community discussions</a> on whether the issue is a browser or a web site issue.

<p>But since the publication of the incident a year ago the way in which the breach occurred remained a mystery.</p>
<p>But this domino effect ruining so many small businesses had another even more devastating angle. Just days before the hack, someone <a href=""http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/8880"">posted on milw0rm</a> a long list of yet unpatched vulnerabilities in Kloxo, a virtual machine management software. The list certainly looks comprehensive enough to enable anyone to penetrate a site using Kloxo, which VAServ where, leading VAServ and others to believe that LxLabs, the Bangalorian software company behind Kloxo is the culprit. Somebody claiming to be the hacker <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/25617/update-new-information-on-the-vaserv-hack-that-wiped-100k-sites/"">commented to the inquistir blog</a>, claiming that weak password at VAServ where to blame for the hack, which <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/10/vaserv_follow_up/"">Rus Foster from VAServ denied</a>.</p>
<p>By exploiting a CSRF bug in twitter (or maybe a feature?) site owners can get twitter profiles of their visitors. For Twitter this is a second this year and now the comprise 50% of the web incidents for 2009. Is this going to be the year of Web 2.0 security?</p>
<p>Celebs are fast becoming a prime hacking target. Miley Cyrus already made her debut at WHID when her Twitter account was raided. But it seems that this was not her first cyber incident for her. As <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/10/miley-cyrus-hac.html"">reported by Wired</a>, late last year a hacker named  Josh Holly published private photos of Ms. Cyrus stolen from her G-mail account.</p>

<p>Cnet <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10162812-83.html"">reports </a>the worm spread on Feb 12<sup>th</sup> in two pulses. After the Twitter people closed the loophole the 1st time, somebody <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10163790-83.html"">bypassed the patch</a> to restart the worm spread out.</p>
<p>Contents of that account, including two sample e-mails, an index of messages and Palin family photos, have been posted by the whistle blower site Wikileaks, which contends that they constitute evidence that Palin has improperly used her private e-mail to shield government business from public scrutiny, an issue that had already been raised by others.</p>
<p>David Kernell, the 20-year-old Tennessee college student was indicted with the hack. The most interesting aspect of the identity of the hacker is that his father Mike Kernell is a longtime Democratic state representative from Memphis</p>
<p><em><strong>Update (Feb 13<sup>th</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - Kasperski hired David Litchfield, a well known database security expert, to analyze the incident. In their <a href=""http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753"">response, </a>Ksaperski point that no sensitive data was actually compromised  to the event. The report points that the hacker and others following his hints did try to access sensitive data but did not succeed. The carefully worded report does leave many questions open:</p>

<p>First, <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/23/embassy_sites_serve_malware/"">hacked embassy sites are becoming a major issue</a> which points to a much larger issue: cyber crime is endangering the Internet as we know it. While we come to rely on the web to provide us with all the information and services that we need, we do not have the tools to make it a safe place, and embassy web sites are a good example.</p>
<p>Firstly, the entire discussion in the references is about the<br />Trojan payload, with no word about the vulnerability that led to the<br />defacement. Actually a reviewer on the SiteAdvisor report gives the<br />green mark to the web site after the Trojan is removed, without<br />requiring any information about the actual problem.</p>
<p>First, the attack came at absolutely the wrong time, just when all eyes (and mouse clicks) where turned to the Olympic games in Beijing, the NDTV web site which carried real time information from the games was hacked, greatly extending the infection rate.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't envy the marketing department role.

<p>Going forward we are going to add such incidents to WHID if there is a reason to believe that they are not friendly, even if the actual goal of the attack cannot be easily classified. The Facebook case at hand is a perfect example: while the details are not clear, the fact that Facebook filed a law suit implies that there is fire behind the smoke.</p>
<p>However, if the site is also vulnerable to CSRF, the XSS exploit can include in addition to the payload also the original XSS inflicting code run under the attacked users credential, modifying his content and therefore hiting his own friends, which hit their own friends and so on.</p>
<p>However new information from the trial of the identity theft ring leader Albert Gonzalez, reveals that in order to penetrate TJX data center from the captured end points, the hackers employed different techniques including password sniffing and SQL injection. The later justifies getting the TJX incident for the 1st time into WHID.</p>
<p>However, phpBB is not entirely off the hook, as the phpBB team <a href=""http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=71&amp;t=29973"">admits</a>. The stolen files included only hashed passwords, however phpBB 2 hash was unsalted and the hackers successfully brute forced 28,000 passwords. While phpBB 3, which is used on the phpBB site uses better password hashing, the upgrade procedure did not upgrade existing users waiting for their 1st login to upgrade. Anyone who did not log-in to the web site since the upgrade still had weakly hashed password in the database.</p>

<p>However, we believe that the resulting ""virtual"" defacement of the web site by redirecting users to a fraudulent web site is still a web hack, even if the DNS hijacking is not web related.</p>
PHP-Nuke is a popular Web content management system (CMS), based on PHP and a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, or Adabas. Earlier versions were open source and free software protected by GNU Public License, but since then it has become commercial software. As it is still very popular in the Internet community, it is not surprising that it has become a target of blackhat attacks.

<p>In this incident a group of people opened accounts at data broker LexisNexis and used automated tools to extract a large amount of personal information provided by the service.</p>
<p>In this story, like most calamities, it seems that the laymen suffer: small entrepreneurs &amp; upstart companies who lost everything in a hacking incident. One of them even lost his life.</p>
<p>It all started on Sunday, June 7<sup>th</sup>: someone broke into the web servers of VAServ, a tiny UK based hosting company. The hackers ruined many of VAServ virtual servers. Some of them lost were for ever as the snippet from VAServ home page, serving as an emergency bulletin board, shows.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this incident is not related to <a href=""http://blog.twitter.com/2009/01/gone-phishing.html"">Twitter phishing attack</a> which occurred on the previous weekend.</p>
<p>It seems that the original report was not accurate and it was not a CSRF vulnerablity that was exploited. The mistake is reported by the victim in an imaginary <a href=""http://www.davidairey.com/google-site-links-gmail-hack-search-penalty/"">discussion with Google</a> blog post (Search the page for XSRF) and by <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html"">Google</a>. Google hints that it was a phishing attack, but David Airey is <a href=""http://www.davidairey.com/google-gmail-phishing-scam/"">not convinced</a>.</p>
<p>Just think about tens of thousand of such stories. Daniel Voyce, a web developer using VAServ for all of his clients, told the <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/08/webhost_attack/"">Register: </a></p>

</p><p>Additional information:</p>
</p><p>Back in 2005 this data breach was one of the first such incidents, generated a lot of media interest, and led to more regulation regarding information aggregators. Interestingly, the excuse given by the company was that the incident was that there was no security failure in the web site, but that the procedures where lacking. We accepted this story at the time, but today we believe that such automation and scraping attacks are among the most dangerous attacks.</p>
</p><p><br />As usual in such cases the actual way in which the information was stolen was not disclosed. A federal trade commission report on the incident, published only in 2007, revealed that the incident was a result on an SQL injection attack on Guidance servers. In a settlement with the FTC, Guidance agreed to implement a comprehensive information security program, including independent, third-party audits every other year for the next ten years.
</p><p><br />Like any DDoS attack, it is very hard to know if it was an application layer or network layer attack, but since this attack had a very significant financial impact by crippling a web site, we think it deserve a place in WHID.
</p><p><br />The direct cost of the breach, informing customers, researching the incident and upgrading the protection of the web site cost the company tens of thousands of dollars.
</p><p><br />The information included personal data such as social security numbers, birth dates, address, phone number, insurance numbers and in some cases the reason for the visit.
</p><p><br />The interesting anecdote is that the person who discovered the issue has used a different, but also questionable technique of maintaining a very large number of portfolios automatically managed by automated programs using the fact that the game allowed a user to have any number of portfolios but only the best one is counted. Kosher, but stinks.
</p><p><br />The site was taken off line for 10 hours to fix the issue. It is a significant incident, as it is one of those rare occasions where vulnerability was serious enough to force the organization to just take the site off line until it is fixed.
</p><p><br />This is a very interesting example of the sensitivity of partial data or small pieces of information and not just the big secrets.
</p><p><br />This story remind <a href="" http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/list_id_2005-36.shtml"">an older story</a> about  a predictable delay in a poker game that enabled gamblers to beat the house.
</p><p><br />We somehow missed this story so it finds its way to WHID only now in late 2007.
</p><p><br />While this might be classified as a business process design flaw, isn't security also about this?
<p>Practically the only way to provide sufficient security to a web site is not to have it in the first place. Instead small organizations must rely on the services of huge brokers, such as Amazon, eBay or Google sites. However not everyone can use this services. Embassies are a good example as they need to be ""doubly localized"" for both the originating and target countries which makes it nearly impossible to create a uniform service for them. Therefore even embassies of larger countries need to create small home made and insecure web sites, as they need to adjust their site content, language and site look to the local community served.</p>
<p>Probably yet another fallout from the on going Asprox attack, this incident is interesting as it emphasises the responsibility that customers expect service providers to take in protecting from web based attacks.</p>",,1/16/2009,SQL Injection,Improper Input Handling,Planting of Malware,Government,UK,No,,,,,,,,

</p><p>The root cause of the breach here is mentioned as being a vulnerability in either Apache, PHP or cPanel. I have selected the third as being more probably until further evidence materialize.</p>
</p><p> The service redirected users to a different server and propagated the user information in a hidden field without re-authenticating.

<p>Recently new articles about the case (listed below) revealed that SQL injection was used by the attackers to install malicious script on the CardSystems web application database which where scheduled to run every four days, extract records, zip them and export them to an FTP site.</p>
<p>Reported by Alexandre Sieira</p>
Prosecutors charged Timothy Peter Noirjean, 26, of Woodbury, with 13 counts of identity theft, alleging that from February 2010 through March 2010 he contacted women online and duped them into providing him with personal information that allowed him to hack their Facebook and other accounts. After hacking a Facebook account, prosecutors say Noirjean would pose as the owner to make contact with that person's friends and try to gain access to more computer accounts.
Prosecutors said the men hired a hacker in Bulgaria  to program a way around the ""CAPTCHA"" technology that requires ticket buyers to read and retype two distorted random words to prove they are people, not a computer program.  In a spectacular irony, the defendents managed to take a process meant to distinguish between a human and a machine - and automate it.

<p>Sage is the leading provider of accounting software in the UK and it was about to launch a trendy small business SaaS offering. However as <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=655"">ZDnet reports</a>, serious security flaws were discovered in the public beta and the company has to call off the launch. Who discovered the issues? naturally the competition.

<p>Secondly, most trust systems, including SiteAdvisor,<br />completely fail to detect the breach. Which makes me think about those<br />trust models: they check that the site was not breached, while they<br />should check that the site is not vulnerable. I guess the reason is<br />that their primary goal is to detect intentionally malicious sites and<br />not breaches is normative sites, but others use them to assess the<br />level of security of the later.<br /></p>

<p>The actual damage to an organization of an attack is rarely disclosed, and coverage focuses on the Number_of_Records stolen.

<p>The <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/04/school_website_defacement/"">incident </a>also highlights the total breakup of cyber security. The incident is blamed on an unpatched version of Moodle, an open source on-line education software. The naive way ot thinking would be that schools don't have the budgets to protect their applications or even to upgrade them. However, as this incident shows, proper security is fundamental and a substantial part of the budget should be allocated to it, even it means we spend less on the application features. We need to move slower but ensure security. After all, what is the value of an educational system that shows porn?</p>
<p>The attack description is vague but can be best described as session hijacking.</p>
<p>The attack is simple, the result pretty frightening. An attacker, presumably Iranian, stole the domain name of David Airey, a graphic artist and a known blogger. The attack was very well timed with David's leaving to a long vacation. The goal was to extort money in order to return the domain. In David's case there is a happy end, as the attention he got helped him receive his blog back, with some loss in traffic, search engine ranking and time. But other victims of the attacker who steal domains for living may not be as fortunate.</p>
<p>The Attack_Method is only described as an exploit of a security hole in the foundation's publishing software. However, the attack looks very much like a variation of the popular iframe injection SQL bots, used for malice rather than profit, hinting that this was an SQL injection attack.</p>
<p>The breach caused severe migraines and near-seizure reactions in some site visitors who viewed the images. People with photosensitive epilepsy can get seizures when they're exposed to flickering images, a response also caused by some video games and cartoons.</p>
<p>The case is also interesting as it put to test the liability of the certifying entity (in this case Savvis) resulting from assessing. The results may have profound influence on the PCI QSA market and therefore PCI itself. David Navetta posts an <a href=""http://infoseccompliance.com/2009/06/03/merrick-bank-v-savvis-analysis-of-the-merrick-bank-complaint/"">excellent legal analysis</a> of the potential implications of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The change was done using correct credentials to login to the administrative web site of Network Solutions, CheckFree domain registrar. It is yet unknown how the hackers got the credentials. Since <a href=""http://www.icann.org/en/committees/security/sac028.pdf"">Phishing attacks against domain registrars</a> including Network Solutions have started to surface recently, a good guess is that it was through a Phishing attack.</p>
<p>The Coleman team <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/41127537.html?elr=KArks8c7PaP3E77K_3c::D3aDhUec7PaP3E77K_0c::D3aDhUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr"">called in the US Secret Service</a> to investigate the leak in which sensitive information about more than 4700 donors was published on Wikileaks, a web site devoted to such exposures. Coleman himself called the incident ""an obviously an attack on my campaign"".</p>
<p>The culprit was an<a href=""http://www.bugreport.ir/index_60.htm""> LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability in PHPlist</a>, an application for managing newsletters which enables the hacker to grab phpBB users list. Another researcher <a href=""http://www.suspekt.org/2009/02/06/some-facts-about-the-phplist-vulnerability-and-the-phpbbcom-hack/"">claims </a>that this is not an LFI but a super-globals-overwrite, which is still used to include files.</p>
<p>The defaced site, as logged by <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/29/comcast_domain_hijacked/"">the register</a> was:</p>
<p>The FTC settlement cost ValueClick a record amount of $2.9 million dollars, plus 20 years of rigorous security procedures that will probably cost as much if not more. On top of that, eBay, a major partner, left ValueClick as a result.
<p>The hack seems to have paid of to Mikeyy Mooney who was <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9131737&amp;intsrc=news_ts_head"">hired to as security consultant</a> following the incident.</p>
<p>The hack was a relatively sophisticated one and a very good example of the risks of Web 2.0. Holly penetrated a MySpace administrator using social engineering. Using the account he gained access to a list of passwords which MySpace stored in an unencrypted form. Unbelievable. Since most of us use the same password for multiple services, Holly used Cyrus' MySpace password on her G-mail account gaining access and retrieving the photographs.</p>
<p>The information stolen includes names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, credit card account numbers and card expiration dates. The Number_of_Records stolen is unknown.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that the site had a Hacker Safe seal. The seal was revoked twice last year due to vulnerabilities, but restored after they where patched. It seems that this time the hack preceded the scan or the scan missed the vulnerability. So much for application scanning and vulnerability assessment....</p>
<p>The Register article is interesting due to another perspective: when discussing the future of Zone-H, John Leyden writes:</p>
<p>The report is unique in describing an attack on financial services. Such attacks are know to happen but are seldom reported, certainly not with the amount of details in this report. However, the report does not indicate which incident it is based on. Is the close proximity of the report release to  the Heartland incident just a coincidence?</p>

<p>The TJX breach is one of most publicized hacking incident in recent years. However, until now it was not part of the Web Hacking Incidents Database. And for a good reason: early report described the hack as a war driving hack, in which the attackers drive around and find a wireless network not properly secured.</p>
<p>The US Federal Trade Commission charged ""life is good"" with lack of reasonable and appropriate security for the sensitive consumer information stored on its servers. The company's settlement with the company requires the company to accept a very comprehensive and costly security procedure going forward.</p>
<p>This entry is a very important one. Most are already familiar with the infamous CardSystems incident where hackers stole 263,000 credit card numbers, exposed 40 million more and several million dollars fraudulent credit and debit card purchases had been made with these counterfeit cards. As a result of the breach CardSystems nearly went out of business and was eventually purchased by PayByTouch. CardSystems is considered by many the most severe publicized information security breach ever and it caused company share holders, financial institutes and card holders damage of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>This incident highlights the issue of public facing administration interfaces, which often combine strong functionality with lesser attention to quality and therefore security. As organizations virtualize, those interfaces become available over the Internet, often without sufficient protection.</p>
<p>This incident is a great example of the lack of sufficient international coverage at WHID. Help us by sending us non English incidents! After all, it is not English speakers only that get hacked, but rather us, the WHID maintainers that speak only this language.</p>
<p>This incident is unique since PlusNet has published a very interesting and revealing report about the incident that shed a lot of light on real world state of life application security. A must read.</p>

<p>This is another example of how fatal is SQL injection.

<p>This is a wonderful example of a web application design flaw. There was nothing wrong with the code, however the design of the feature enabled it to be abused.</p>
<p>This is one of the most stunning examples where a web application security hole was used to launch a targeted attack in order to steal money.</p>
<p>This method has another advantage over a redirection page, as the final target is specified by a search string and not by a URL, bypassing smarter filters that know, or learn, that a URL as a parameter of a URL is most probably redirection.</p>
<p>This specific poll distortion <a href=""http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/15/inside-the-precision-hack/"">reported by Paul <span><span>Lamere</span></span></a> is unique since a group of hackers called 4chan, led by ""moot"", took the time to fight Time's humble attempts to mitigate automation.

<p>Twitter <a href=""http://blog.twitter.com/2009/01/monday-morning-madness.html"">announced </a>that a hacker broke into 33 accounts including Obama's now inactive twitter. The hack is a result of a flaw in a web based support tool used by twitter, which where evidently accessible externally without proper authorization.</p>
<p>Twitter is in the spotlights again. Mikeyy Mooney, the 17-year-old creator of StalkDaily.com, a Twitter alternative, <a href=""http://www.bnonews.com/news/242.html"">admitted </a>to hacking his giant competitor by implementing a worm that propagated itself through twitter making every affected user tweet about StalkDaily. Mikeyy certainly got the advertising and page views he was looking for.</p>
</p></ul>
<p>Uno presents a dilemma: he finds a vulnerability, exploits it to a limit and publish the results. Therefore the incident does not have a sizable outcome and not damage is done, but nevertheless it is interesting. We are not the only one to note that. Kasperski stressed the point the no data was actually compromised in their <a href=""http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753"">response </a>to the event. So should we add it to WHID as an incident? should we skip it as just a vulnerability? for now we put them in.</p>

<p>We can hardly include every malware service site in WHID, after all there are hundred of thousands, if not millions, of those. Why pick on the Indian embassy in Spain? One good reason is that we finally got in an input from a reader and wanted to honor the event and include the incident. But there is another more important reason.</p>
<p>We may never know who is right and who is wrong. LxLabs, just like Vaserv, is a tiny company using the Internet to look big. However one area that suffers a lot in small companies, is their security. It is never important enough to invest resource in security in such a lean and mean operations.</p>
<p>West's story is somewhat ironic as he used his blog to remind users of the untruthfulness of his web presence.</p>
<p>We where informed by sources at eBay the Korean sites parent company that the issue was not CRSF or seesion hijacking. The Attack_Method was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Whenever we include a site inflicted with malware in WHID we need to explain why this one is worthy of WHID, after hundreds of thousands of web sites are planted with malware annually.</p>

<p>While it is usually not considered a vulnerability in the application itself, I think that application that expose administrative or high privileges interface to the web should include authentication beyond a simple password. A school grading system is one example. The Twitter administrative interface <a href=""/whid-2009-2"">hacked last week</a> is another example.</p>
<p>While officials in Indiana tried to write it off as a harmless prank played by a teenager, the U.S. Department of Justice has also been investigating the case, and they believe the same hacker is responsible for attempts on other state government web sites.</p>
<p>While the actual technique used is not known, signs are that it was a web hack as it was done by a distributed network of bots all over the world and since the information stolen belonged to customers who paid online.</p>
<p>While the information was pulled of line after a short period of time, it remained in the cache of several major search engines.</p>
<p>While this may be nothing more than a joke, the capability to create a trend can have a huge and sometimes devastating effect. After all in recent months the future of big financial institutes was determined by the rumor mill.</p>
<p>Why New Hampshire? Because the company has to report to the<br />authorities there about the incidents, but only specify the number of<br />individuals from this state affected. Why only New Hampshire? Since<br />regulations and bills requiring disclosures exist in many states, one<br />would expect that the company would have to provide such a testimonial<br />in many states.

The vulnerability enables the malicious website to impersonate any other websites to cheat Facebook, and obtain the same data access permissions on Facebook those websites receive. Bing.com by default has the permission to access any Facebook users' basic information such as name, gender, etc, so our malicious website is able to de-anonymize the users by impersonating Bing.com. In addition, due to business needs, there are many websites requesting more permissions, including accessing to a user's private data, and publishing content on Facebook on her behalf. Therefore, by impersonating those websites, our website can obtain the same permissions to steal the private data or post phishing messages on Facebook on the user's behalf.

This morning at 7:33 Broken Arrow mom Becki Santucci heard a ding in her purse.
This payload contains two parts: ap.js, and the obfuscation code in the script tag. When combined, we get the entire exploit code. After analyzing this, we noticed that it is used to target the IE vulnerability (MS10-018), which downloads an executable file named dn.exe. This has a good detection rate by most  AV vendors; however dn.exe will download and execute remote files and send local information to a remote server.  The process disguises itself as an AV component while at the same time suspending the AV software. At present, a bug in the malicious code fails to get the MAC address correctly and as of this alert the site is still infected.",http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2010/05/25/chinaz-com-compromised.aspx,5/25/2010,Unknown,Improper Output Handling,Planting of Malware,Information Services,China,No,,,,,,,,

This time around the danger came from clicking links contained in micro-blogging messages beginning ""WTF [URL]"". Last week's more serious onMouseOver problem struck when users moved their mouse cursor over an infected tweet. These messages contained hidden JavaScript code that exploited a cross-site scripting problem - in the case of the WTF worm a CSRF (cross-site request forgery) technique is in play.

Unfortunately all the of attention has made it the target of some unscrupulous individuals. Around 3:00pm Tuesday afternoon we noticed that an individual was voting in the poll once every 10 seconds, and did this activity for nearly 2 hours.
Unknown pranksters defaced the page with a message suggesting that Facebook ought to allow ordinary users to invest in the site in a ""social way"", rather than getting its financing from the banks.

Update (Jan 10, 2009) - Zone-H reports that in addition to Israeli sites, Turkish hackers are also targetting USA and Nato web sites using SQL injection.
Upon checking the logs we realized there were multiple users engaging in this sort of behavior from multiple vectors forcing us to remove the poll entirely. In terms of a long term solution, it seems inevitable that we will adopt a system that requires a KVOA.com user account in order to vote in a poll, but that modification cannot be patched in on the fly and would require a few days work.",http://www.kvoa.com/news/poll-removed-due-to-widespread-ballot-stuffing-and-hacking/,5/25/2010,Brute Force,Insufficient Anti-automation,Fraud,Media,USA,No,,,,,,,,

Users trying to access certain websites hosted by the ISP were greeted with a blank home page and a message that said the website had been hacked.
Users who accessed hotmail.co.il and msn.co.il earlier today were greeted by a page displaying the image of a child wearing the Palestinian flag as a cape and a message reading, ""Free Palestine. Hi to greatest [expletive] of the world (i mean all the Jews). u think one day u will own all the world eh? Lol that makes me laugh. that makes all the world laugh. u are just insects. make muslims angrier and just sit and watch what will happen to you."" The attacker signs the messsage as TurkGuvenligi Tayfa (""from Turkey with love"") and sends greetings to Pakbugs, a notorious group of hackers and defacers.

""We do not know who is behind the attacks or what their motivation is,"" the club's board said in an emailed statement explaining it had decided to shut down temporarily the site after two days of ""persistent"" attacks.
???We have crashed three servers, and in examining those servers, there are two unidentified sites that are deliberately diverting traffic,??? said Butler County Board of Elections Director Betty McGary as her frenzied staff struggled to post election results.
???We have reported the bugs in the website and problems with database management system and coding. We had earlier told the systems department of the AMC about a system that can be exploited with username and password as simple ???0???. The vulnerability has been fixed by now but there are bigger challenges,??? said Sunny Vaghela, a city-based cyber crime expert. 
Well, not really. Even after I sent a bunch of emails to all their addresses that I could find and requested on twitter for contacts in the .ge government, nobody replied and they are still hacked, spreading malware and attacking other systems.
""We made a change to a persistent copy of a configuration value that was interpreted as invalid,"" explained Robert Johnson in Facebook's blog post about the incident. ""This meant that every single client saw the invalid value and attempted to fix it. Because the fix involves making a query to a cluster of databases, that cluster was quickly overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of queries per second.""
We're reinstalling the system and restoring the data from a safe backup, November 23th circa 12:00 GMT.
""We're working to identify the exploit and will bring the site back online shortly,"" the message read.
""We saw thousands of hits on our Department of Transportation driver license exam scheduling site coming out of Russia, the same thing over and over, scheduling driver license exams. It was encrypted traffic, and we were trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Were they trying to test our systems? What exactly were they up to? The answer was, we really didn't know.""
""We've got to the bottom of this problem and are just waiting for the all clear from Google,"" they told The Register.

???What we don???t know is whether the hacker was able to access any information,??? Faust said.
When a gambler signs up for a player club card, they are usually rewarded with fifty or one hundred players points. As the gambler plays at the tables and on the slot machines, points are accumulated and used for such things as free hotel rooms and food. The points can sometimes be used as free play on the slot machines. 
When contacted by ABCNews.com, a man who asked to be named as a Goatse employee confirmed Gawker's report.

# A brief history of the modern Web Platform

## 2004-02

- [CSS 2.1 Candidate Recommendation (CR)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/)
  published; the spec will later go back to normal Working Draft status for
  a time and then return again to CR in July 2007 before finally being
  published in June 2011 as a full W3C Recommendation.

- [Safari 1.2](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_02.html#004874)
  released; notable in that it's the first version of Safari with
  XMLHttpRequest (XHR) support (following Internet Explorer and Firefox).

- [Flickr launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr); making
  innovative use of XHR and client-side browser technologies to drive its
  user interface, adding
  ["tagging" features inspired by del.icio.us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29#History),
  and eventually moving to provide APIs to expose Flickr for data using in
  other sites and Web applications, it will go on to be often cited as a
  key example of a
  ["Web 2.0"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)
  site/service.

- [Gmail launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail),
  in invitation-only beta, and
  [Facebook launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Facebook#2004),
  with membership initially restricted to students of Harvard University.

## 2004-04

- [Web Applications 1.0 first public draft published](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/apps/web-apps-1)
  by Ian Hickson (the document will eventually form the basis for the HTML5
  spec).

  The publication of the Web Applications 1.0 first draft follows a couple
  of blog postings from Ian Hickson earlier in the year,
  [Ramblings from the North](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1080506019&count=1)
  and
  [Void filling: Web Applications Language](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1074466808&count=1),
  in which Hickson writes:

  > About 11 months ago, I mentioned that the W3C had so far failed to
  > address a need in the Web community: There is no language for Web
  > applications[...] I've been taking the opportunity to work on a
  > proposal for a Web Applications specification[...] something along the
  > same lines as Web Forms 2, but specifically for client-side application
  > development.

  In the following month, Hickson writes a related
  [Backwards Compatibility](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1085764602&count=1)
  blog posting in which is gives some more detail about the rationale
  behind the Web Applications 1.0 spec:

  > Authors still want to write Web applications, and the currently
  > deployed standards are inadequate. Since completely new standards won't
  > cut it [...] this leaves us with the solution we (Opera and Mozilla)
  > have been advocating: updating HTML and the DOM.

## 2004-06

- [WHATWG launched](http://www.whatwg.org/news/start); announcement:

  > The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
  > technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web Applications
  > [...] for implementation in mass-market Web browsers, in particular
  > Safari, Mozilla, and Opera; [the group] intends to ensure that all its
  > specifications address backwards compatibility concerns [...] and
  > specify error handling behavior to ensure interoperability even in the
  > face of documents that do not comply to the letter of the
  > specifications.

  The announcement of the launch of the WHATWG follows just after a
  [W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents](http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/)
  held at Adobe offices in San Jose. For the workshop, Opera and Mozilla
  jointly submit and present a position paper with a set of proposed
  [Design Principles for Web Application Technologies](http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html);
  but some
  [subsequent blog postings](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/2004WebAppsWorkshop/reactions)
  from Brendan Eich, David Baron, and Ian Hickson make it clear that they've
  come away from the workshop with a realization that their goals with respect
  to Web applications are not in sync with others in attendance. Brendan Eich:

  > The dream of a new web, based on XHTML+SVG+SMIL+XForms, is just that --
  > a dream. It won't come true no matter how many toy implementations
  > there are[...] The best way to help the Web is to incrementally improve
  > the existing web standards, with compatibility shims provided for IE,
  > so that web content authors can actually deploy new formats
  > interoperably[...] Mozilla is joining with Opera and others to explore
  > the sort of incremental improvements to HTML proposed by us at the
  > workshop.

## 2004-07 to 2004-12

- [HTML `canvas` element created by the Safari team at Apple](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1089635050&count=1)
  and
  [first specified as part of Web Applications 1.0](http://web.archive.org/web/20041009144718/http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/).

- [The possibility of an "HTML 5.0 specification" is mentioned](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2004Aug/0345.html)
  in a message from Anne van Kesteren on the WHATWG mailing list; and in a
  [later reply on the same list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2004Nov/0030.html),
  Ian Hickson says that "at this point Web Apps [Web Applications 1.0] is
  basically HTML5"; subsequently, the term *HTML5* begins to be used in
  WHATWG discussions as a shorthand name for the Web Applications 1.0 spec.

- [Ruby on Rails first released](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails#History)
  by David Heinemeier Hansson. Among other things, it becomes notable as
  one of the first server-side Web-application development frameworks that
  provide specific support for XHR-driven Web applications (what will in
  2005 start to referred to as "Ajax" applications).

- [Opera begins to ship pre-installed on some mobile devices](http://www.kddi.com/english/corporate/news_release/2004/1006/),
  becoming -- three years before the release of iPhone and mobile Safari --
  the first "full" mobile browser (non-WAP, JavaScript-enabled, using the
  same browser engine as desktop Opera) to generate any significant mobile
  browsing traffic to normal (non-WAP) websites (though the usage largely
  comes just from mobile phones in Japan, which at that time are still
  significantly more advanced than mobile devices elsewhere in the world).

- [Web 2.0 Conference](http://web.archive.org/web/20041001091530/www.web2con.com/pub/w/32/program.html)
  takes place in San Francisco, eventually causing the term *Web 2.0* to be
  brought into general use.

## 2005-02

- [Google Maps launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_maps#History)
  in beta with support across all major browsers (Internet Explorer, Mozilla,
  Opera, and Safari), following just after the launch, two months earlier, of
  [Google Suggest](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html)
  as a Google "Labs" project.

- [Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/essays/archives/000385.php)
  by Jesse James Garrett; coining the term *Ajax* to describe XHR-driven
  modern Web applications, Garrett specifically mentions JSON as a "means
  of structuring data for interchange" in such applications, and cites
  Gmail, Google Suggest, Google Maps, and Flickr as examples.

- [Prototype JavaScript Framework created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_JavaScript_Framework)
  by Sam Stephenson; included with Ruby on Rails, it's one of the first
  JavaScript libraries to include specific mechanisms for building
  XHR-driven applications.

## 2005-03 to 2005-06

- [Cross-document messaging (`postMessage`)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050301091946/http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/)
  first specified, as part of Web Applications 1.0.

- [CouchDB created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB#History)
  by Damien Katz; it's notable in being intended as a "database that
  completely embraces the web" -- using JSON, JavaScript, and HTTP, and
  fundamentally designed for serving Web applications. (More specifically,
  it's schema-less and non-relational, storing data as JSON-formatted
  semi-structured documents, built on a non-SQL, JavaScript-based query
  mechanism -- with a MapReduce-driven view model -- and with a RESTful
  HTTP API for consuming and exposing data in JSON (PUT/POST data as JSON
  objects, and GET results as JSON objects).

- [Acid2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid2) published by Ian Hickson as a
  means to test the level of standards conformance in Web browsers.

- [Opera 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Version_8)
  released; notable in that it's the first release version of Opera with
  (limited) XHR support, which finally makes XHR available across all major
  browser engines.

- [The Web Platform - Browsers and Applications](http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/0513-webplatform/)
  talk presented by Dean Jackson in the W3C track at WWW2005, with the
  goals of the "Web Platform" outlined as:

  * To (better) enable the Web as an application platform (on all devices)
  * To help users by requiring support for standards in the browser.
  * To give Web developers a better programming environment (with new
    interfaces).

  Going forward, the term "the Web Platform" will come into increasing use
  specifically for describing the standard set of client-side technologies
  made available in browsers, for building modern Web applications.

- [script.aculo.us created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script.aculo.us)
  by Thomas Fuchs; built on top of the Prototype JavaScript Framework and
  included in Ruby on Rails, it's one of the first "Ajax" script libraries
  to come into wide use.

## 2005-07 to 2005-11

- [`<!DOCTYPE html>` (HTML5 doctype) first introduced](http://web.archive.org/web/20050701075402/http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/).

- [Client-side local storage](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2005-09-01/)
  first specified, as part of Web Applications 1.0.

- [del.icio.us begins providing a RESTful HTTP API that makes data available in JSON](http://inkdroid.org/journal/2005/09/21/delicious-json/);
  within the next three years, Flickr, Yahoo, Google, and most other major
  providers of Web-based services begin to provide similar HTTP APIs that
  expose data formatted in JSON.

- [What Is Web 2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html)
  article by Tim O'Reilly. Subsequent discussions of the term *Web 2.0*
  often cite this article; excerpt:

  > It's clear that standards and solutions [...] will enable the next
  > generation of applications. [...] AJAX is also a key component of Web
  > 2.0 applications such as Flickr[...] We're entering an unprecedented
  > period of user interface innovation, as web developers are finally able
  > to build web applications as rich as local PC-based applications.

- [Web API](http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/) and
  [Web Application Formats](http://www.w3.org/2006/appformats/)
  Working Groups chartered at the launch of the W3C
  [Rich Web Client Activity](http://www.w3.org/News/2005#x200501115c).

  The Web API Working Group mission is described as being to "enable
  improved client-side application development on the Web" and its a scope
  includes, among other things, documenting the Window and XMLHttpRequest
  (XHR) interfaces and the `setTimeout` method, as well as specifying
  "network communication methods" and a means for "persistent storage on
  the client" to facilitate "more advanced Web applications, enabling them
  to store user preferences and possibly work in an offline environment,
  such as a laptop or mobile phone with intermittent connectivity".

## 2006-01 to 2006-02

- [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/versions/?page=5#version-0.2)
  first version released by Joe Hewitt.

- [Opera Mini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mini)
  released; it will play a role in expanding Web access to more parts of
  the world, and will end up consistently accounting for a significant
  percentage of worldwide mobile Web-browsing traffic.

- [JSON Internet Draft published](http://ietfreport.isoc.org/all-ids/draft-crockford-jsonorg-json-00.txt)
  by Doug Crockford; however, it
  [had already been documented by Crockford elsewhere](https://web.archive.org/web/20030417010540/http://www.crockford.com/JSON/)
  going back to at least late 2002, and a number of major Web-based
  services had already started to provide APIs that exposed data formatted
  in JSON.

- [HTML parsing algorithm](http://web.archive.org/web/20060202011253/http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/)
  first specified, as part of Web Applications 1.0.

## 2006-07 to 2006-11

- [Twitter first launched](http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/)
  and
  [Facebook first opened widely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Facebook#2006)
  for all users to join.

- [jQuery 1.0](http://blog.jquery.com/2006/08/26/jquery-10/) released.

- [Internet Explorer version 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Version_7)
  released with CSS and DOM improvements -- five years after the release of IE6.

- [Reinventing HTML](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166)
  posting by Tim Berners-Lee:

  > Some things are clearer with hindsight of several years. It is
  > necessary to evolve HTML incrementally. The attempt to get the world to
  > switch to XML, including quotes around attribute values and slashes in
  > empty tags and namespaces all at once didn't work[...] The plan is to
  > charter a completely new HTML group. Unlike the previous one, this one
  > will be chartered to do incremental improvements to HTML, as also in
  > parallel xHTML.

- [Proposed charter](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/0045.html)
  for HTML Working group posted by Ian Hickson (following
  [the earlier posting of shorter proposed charter](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/0000.html),
  [specific feedback](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/0000.html)
  and some
  [public discussion about charter review](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2006Nov/thread.html#msg53)).

## 2007-03 to 2007-05

- [Fifth W3C HTML Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter.html)
  chartered (though only the second W3C HTML working group to focus on the core
  HTML language), with a mission *to continue the evolution of HTML (including
  classic HTML and XML syntaxes)* and with a statement that *this group
  will maintain and produce incremental revisions to the HTML specification [to
  produce] a language evolved from HTML4 for describing the semantics of
  documents and applications on the World Wide Web.*

- [`video` and `audio` elements added to the HTML spec](http://html5.org/r/394-699).

- [Google Gears](http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/posted-by-aaron-boodman-and-erik.html)
  released; some of its key features, such as its "workerpool" mechanism,
  eventually become standard parts of the Web platform, and by the end of
  2009 its development will end up being permanently halted.

## 2007-06 to 2007-12

- [iPhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_iPhone#World_timeline)
  first released; notable among other things in that it doesn't include
  support for Adobe Flash, it will end up consistently accounting for
  significantly more mobile Web-browsing traffic than any other mobile
  device.

- [HTML "offline Web applications" feature introduced](http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=848&to=1115)
  (`applicationCache` interface, _aka_ appCache)

- [CSS Transforms](https://www.webkit.org/blog/130/css-transforms/) 
  and
  [CSS Transitions](https://www.webkit.org/blog/138/css-animation/)
  (`transform-*` and `transition-*` properties) created by the Safari team at Apple.

- [Downloadable-fonts support added to WebKit](https://www.webkit.org/blog/124/downloadable-fonts/);
  (`@font-face` rule). Eventually, by mid-2009, downloadable fonts will be
  supported in all major browsers. (Note that Internet Explorer was the
  first to have downloadable-fonts support, starting with the release of
  IE4 in 1997 -- and the feature had actually been part of the CSS2.0
  Recommendation published in 1998.)

- [Futhark JavaScript engine released in beta](http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2007/10/25/opera-9-5-beta-released)
  as part of Opera 9.5; for a time it will be the fastest JavaScript engine
  on the market, and help to initiate a JavaScript-engine performance race
  among browser projects, starting in mid-2008.

- [Android mobile-device platform announced](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html);
  it is notable for including a mobile browser that uses WebKit as its
  browser engine; however, it will be nearly a year before any Android
  devices actually begin to ship.

- [SunSpider JavaScript benchmark introduced](https://www.webkit.org/blog/152/announcing-sunspider-09/)
  by the Safari team at Apple; during the latter half of 2008 and after, it
  will become widely used by other major browser projects in documenting
  the relative performance improvements in their JavaScript engines.

## 2008-01 to 2008-06

- [First W3C Working Draft of HTML5 published](http://www.w3.org/News/2008.html#entry-6935).

- [Acid3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3)
  published by Ian Hickson as a means to test the level of standards
  conformance in Web browsers.

- [GitHub launched](https://github.com/blog/40-we-launched).

- [SquirrelFish JavaScript engine announced](https://www.webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/)
  by the Safari team at Apple; it's an incremental rewrite of Safari's
  "JavaScriptCore" engine to turn it into a bytecode interpreter, resulting
  in large performance improvements.

  During the following months, other browser projects begin to rewrite
  their JavaScript engines in a race that over the following next few years
  eventually results in vastly improved overall speed of JavaScript
  execution across all major browsers.

- [W3C Web Applications Working Group launched](http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/286);
  the group merges the existing Web APIs Working Group and Web Application
  Formats Working Group into a single group, with a mission to *provide
  specifications that enable improved client-side application development
  on the Web*

- [Geolocation API first Editor's Draft written and announced](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-geolocation/2008Jun/0000.html)
  by Andrei Popescu.

## 2008-07 to 2008-10

- [Web Sockets and Web Workers first specified](http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=1835&to=1968).

- [Geolocation API ships in Google Gears 0.4](http://gearsblog.blogspot.jp/2008/08/gears-04-is-here.html),
  the first implementation of the Geolocation API to be made available.

- [Firefox developer builds begin shipping with TraceMonkey](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10023723-92.html),
  a JIT-based JavaScript engine (compiling JavaScript to native machine
  code) that provides greatly improved JavaScript performance.

- [Google Chrome first released](http://googleblog.blogspot.jp/2008/09/google-chrome-now-live.html),
  with WebKit as its browser engine, and notable for being the first
  release version of a browser to ship with a JIT-based JavaScript engine,
  V8, which provides greatly improved JavaScript performance on par with
  Mozilla's TraceMonkey (which had been released to developers less that a
  month earlier).

- [WebKit announces SquirrelFish Extreme](https://www.webkit.org/blog/214/introducing-squirrelfish-extreme/),
  a new JIT-based JavaScript engine with performance on par with V8 and
  TraceMonkey.

  Over the coming months, the browser projects will all race with each
  other further to incrementally improve the performance of their
  JavaScript engines, with the result over the long term being a vast
  improvement in the overall speed of JavaScript execution across all major
  browsers -- which among other things ends up enabling browsers to behave
  performantly with JavaScript-heavy Web application even on mobile devices
  with relatively limited RAM and CPU resources.

- [First Android device ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream#History):
  the HTC dream, running Android 1.6; notable in that it's the first
  non-iPhone smartphone to ship with a WebKit-based browser. Other
  Android-based mobile devices will begin to ship in 2009, resulting in
  Android devices accounting for a significant percentage of
  mobile-browsing traffic by the end of 2010, when Android becomes the
  most widely used smartphone platform worldwide.

- [Geolocation API ships in Firefox 3.1 beta](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/10/first-look-firefox-3-1-beta-1-officially-released/).

## 2009-02 to 2009-06

- [CSS Animations created by the Safari team at Apple](https://www.webkit.org/blog/324/css-animation-2/)
  (`@keyframes` rule and `animation-*` properties).

- [Internet Explorer version 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Windows_Internet_Explorer_8)
  released; it is the first version of IE to pass [Acid2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid2).

- [Node.js first released](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/80eed19612db0fe54191683e8a9f0bc5c1ca4ff6)
  by Ryan Dahl; it's a software platform notable for being built around the
  V8 JavaScript engine -- providing a way for developers to do server-side
  development in JavaScript using a non-threaded, non-blocking "evented
  I/O"-based, asynchronous callback-driven programming model similar to the
  client-side event-loop-based programming model provided by Web browsers.

- [Geolocation API support ships in i0S 3.0](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/06/geolocating-your-iphone-users.html),
  making the iPhone the first mobile device with native support for the
  Geolocation API in its browser. (Support for Android devices will ship a
  few months later, in Android 2.0).

## 2009-09

- [WebGL support lands in Firefox Nightly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/09/webgl-for-firefox/)
  and, shortly after, also
  [lands in WebKit nightlies](https://www.webkit.org/blog/603/webgl-now-available-in-webkit-nightlies/)
  and [Chrome developer builds](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/chromium-dev/DusnVs_TGGA/Z9p_p3joTy4J)
  -- thought the WebGL specification
  [isn't actually published until December 2009](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/public-mailing-list/archives/0912/msg00000.html).

## 2010-02

- [Google Gears development officially stopped](http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html)
  by the Gears team at Google, following a gradual shift "towards bringing
  all of the Gears capabilities into web standards like HTML5".

## 2010-04

- [Steve Jobs "Thoughts on Flash"](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/);
  excerpt:

  > [...] the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and
  > open web standards  all areas where Flash falls short[.] Rather than
  > use Flash, Apple has adopted HTML5, CSS and JavaScript  all open
  > standards[...] Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5
  > tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the
  > past behind.

## 2011-03

- [Internet Explorer version 9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9)
  released, with major improvements in standards support (including support
  for the Geolocation API, SVG and the HTML `canvas` and `video` elements).

- [Video conferencing and peer-to-peer communication](http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=5944&to=5945)
  section added to the WHATWG HTML spec by Ian Hickson.

  [Announced on the WHATWG mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2011Mar/0238.html),
  this new section of the HTML spec introduces the `getUserMedia` method,
  `PeerConnection` interface, and `MediaStream` interface (initially just
  named `Stream`). The content of the section will eventually be forked
  by the W3C WebRTC Working Group to create the
  [WebRTC spec](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html), but even
  at this point in 2011 when it is first introduced, it already provides
  for all of the following:

  > Getting a multimedia stream (video, audio, or both) from local devices
  > (video cameras, microphones, Web cams) or from prerecorded files
  > provided by the user; Recording such streams locally; Connecting to
  > remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as ICE, STUN, and
  > TURN; Sending the locally-produced streams to remote peers and
  > receiving streams from remote peers; Displaying such streams (both the
  > locally-produced ones and the remotely-obtained ones) locally using the
  > video or audio elements; Sending arbitrary data to remote peers.

## 2011-11

- [Flash Player for mobile devices end-of-lifed by Adobe](http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html);
  the news is widely interpreted as a major shift by Adobe toward HTML5 and
  away from Flash; excerpt from the announcement:

  > HTML5 is now universally supported on major mobile devices, in some
  > cases exclusively. This makes HTML5 the best solution for creating and
  > deploying content in the browser across mobile platforms.

## 2012-02

- [Adobe reduces Flash roadmap to just two areas: gaming and premium video](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplatform/whitepapers/roadmap.html);
  the news is widely interpreted as a further focusing by Adobe away from
  Flash and toward HTML5 and other "modern web technologies":

  > With the growth of competition in the browser market, browser vendors
  > are increasingly innovating and providing functionality that makes it
  > possible to deploy rich motion graphics directly via browser
  > technologies, a role once served primarily by Flash Player.
  > Increasingly, rich motion graphics are being deployed directly via the
  > browser using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and other modern web
  > technologies. Adobe expects that this trend will continue and
  > accelerate, and Adobe will continue to play an active role in this
  > space.
